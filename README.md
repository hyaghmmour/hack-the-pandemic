### Problem

The biggest issue we had when attempting to predict the first round of COVID was a lack of data. Due to the virus being new, every move of the virus was unique, therefore unpredictable. However, new technologies and an infinite influx of data allow for more accurate and safer modeling technologies to become apparent.

- Lack of Data
- Reactive rather than predictive
- Accuracy/effectiveness of the solution

### Solution

Subsequently, this influx of data allows for advanced data modeling and analytic tools (such as Machine Learning) to be leveraged to create predictive software tools. Which is how this idea came to be. This software tool leverages deep learning as well as available tools such as previous or live data and creates a live reactive and predictive model of future covid data.

- Why our solution is best:
  - Leveraging AI will increase the accuracy of data
  - Utilizing blockchain will increase security

### Impact

- Hospitals are better prepared in terms of knowing what volume of patients to expect based on predictions.
- The supply chain of PPEs and other protected health materials is more adapted to the trends in COVID cases so as to reduce periods of scarcity of these supplies in the hospitals.

### Data being used

Each region is different, which is why the algorithm is designed to incorporate all aspects which spread the virus faster/slower. The software will show all relevant news of each highlighted area as well as the immediate effect of the news on the spread. However, this will not be a factor in the algorithm due to biases.

### Roadblocks

The biggest difficulty would most likely be acquiring the proper data parameters as they vary by region. However, this is easily solved by the widespread use of open-source APIs and platforms to access this data within each location.

### Technologies

For this particular project, we plan on leveraging data analytics and machine learning using Python. Secondly, we will need a backend cloud platform to help speed up processes on remote servers for which AWS or GCP could be used. Next, we need a way to visualize this data in the front end, of which we could use React.js. Finally, we need a way for the frontend to talk to our backend, for this we would need to create an API with Node or Express.js.
